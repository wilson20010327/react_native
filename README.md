# React Native 01
Why using Expo platform ?
1. Let the writer can focus on Javascript, don't need to deel with Native
2. Provide some useful API in it's library
3. Build the project and test it on phones(Android or IOS) in realtime with the app(expo go) on phones
4. Can release the app in .apk or .ipa ,without open neither XCode nor Android Studio
## Install 
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/zh-tw/download/)
* [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)
